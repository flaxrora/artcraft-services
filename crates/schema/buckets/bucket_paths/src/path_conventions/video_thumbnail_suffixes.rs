//! |---------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `NULL`  | 2024-02-28               | `-thumb.jpg`, `-thumb.gif` (legacy, or not yet generated)  |
//! | `1`     | 2026-03-18               | `-thumb.jpg`, `-thumb.gif`                                 |
//! | `2`     | 2026-09 (see below)      | `-thumb.jpg`, `-thumb.webp`, `-thumb.gif`                  |
//!
//! * **`NULL`**: No version recorded. Clients have linked `-thumb.gif` and
//!   `-thumb.jpg` since 2024-02-28 ("video card thumbnails", e7a427289f), so
//!   older rows may have GIF/JPG files from earlier pipelines, or none at all.
//!   A `NULL` row may also just be waiting for the thumbnail job. Serving uses
//!   the `created_at` cutover in [`animated_preview_format`] to pick GIF or WebP.
//! * **`1`**: Written by `video-thumbnail-job` since it launched on 2026-03-18
//!   (#1157). A first-frame JPG and an animated GIF: the first 5 seconds at
//!   10 fps, fit within 360x360.
//! * **`2`**: Same JPG, plus an animated WebP (quality 60) of the same frames,
//!   which is typically 6-50x smaller than the GIF. The job still writes the
//!   GIF too ("dual writes"); see "macOS Catalina" below. Deployed in late
//!   September 2026. TODO(bt): Replace "2026-09" above with the exact deploy date.
//!
//! # macOS Catalina and GIF dual writes
//!
//! Animated WebP needs WebKit on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or newer. ArtCraft desktop
//! (Tauri) uses the system WKWebView, so on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) a WebP in
//! an `<img>` doesn't render. Version 2 therefore keeps writing `-thumb.gif`
//! beside the WebP, and the API exposes it as the Catalina fallback so the
//! desktop app can fall back to it. We may keep the GIF dual writes forever;
//! drop them only once no supported client needs them.
//!
//! # Changing this scheme
//!
//! These suffixes are how files are physically named in the public bucket and
//! are shared between services. Never change or reuse a suffix or a version
//! number. Add a new version instead, and update [`animated_preview_format`].

///       WHERE maybe_thumbnail_version IS NULL AND media_class = 'video'
///       AND created_at < '2026-10-10'`.
///      (Rows inside the lookback window must be left `NULL`, or the job
///      will skip them.)
///   3. `NULL` then only means "not generated yet", so serve the current
///      format for it: delete this constant and the `created_at` argument to
